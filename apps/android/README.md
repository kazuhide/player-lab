# Bitmovin Player sample for Android and Fire TV

Kotlin sample using the Bitmovin Player library, with a Compose control panel and
`PlayerView`. The app targets phones, tablets, Android TV, and Android-based Fire
TV devices. DVR means the window of live media that a viewer can rewind.

## Layout

- `dvr/`: Kotlin module with rewind-window calculations and tests for the Java
  Virtual Machine; these tests do not need the Android SDK.
- `app/`: Android player and controls. Shared Web UI assets are loaded through
  `UiConfig.WebUi` from `file:///android_asset/`.

## Test the rewind logic

From the repository root, with a Java development kit installed:

```bash
cd apps/android && ./gradlew :dvr:test
```

## Build the app

Use Java 17 and an Android SDK matching the requirements in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
`settings.gradle.kts` includes the app module when `ANDROID_HOME`,
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, or `local.properties` supplies an SDK context. Player
artifacts are resolved from `artifacts.bitmovin.com`.

Set your keys in the repository-root `.env` as described in `docs/SETUP.md`.
From the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-env.sh
pnpm --filter @showcase/ui-shared build && pnpm sync:webui
cd apps/android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

You can also open `apps/android` in Android Studio. The Gradle properties
`-PbitmovinLicenseKey=…` and `-PbitmovinAnalyticsLicenseKey=…` take precedence over
`bitmovinLicenseKey` and `bitmovinAnalyticsLicenseKey` in the untracked
`local.properties`. The sync script updates those entries from `.env` while
preserving the local SDK path.

Allow `com.showcase.dvr` on your player license. The analytics key is optional;
when provided, the bundled collector reports playback-quality measurements to
your account. Do not commit keys or local SDK configuration.

## Shared player UI

The "UI" picker selects the default Web UI or the Sports, Live, and Cinema
factories from `@showcase/ui-shared`. A custom mode creates a configuration such as:

```kotlin
PlayerViewConfig(uiConfig = UiConfig.WebUi(
    jsLocation = "file:///android_asset/bitmovinplayer-ui.js",
    cssLocation = "file:///android_asset/bitmovinplayer-ui.css",
    variant = Variant.Custom("bitmovin.playerui.UIFactory.buildSportsUI")
))
```

The app recreates `PlayerView` when the mode changes. The build-and-sync command
above writes the ignored assets under `app/src/main/assets/`.

The shared UI uses `bitmovin-player-ui` 4.x. A successful Android build does not
establish that it renders correctly in the native player library's WebView;
check rendering and input on each target.

## Playback checks

Unit tests and APK builds do not verify licensed playback. On a device or
emulator, check live seeking, returning to live, and recovery when paused media
expires. Android TV and Fire TV also need remote-control checks; the app declares
a `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` entry for TV launchers. Use your own license and reachable
test streams.
